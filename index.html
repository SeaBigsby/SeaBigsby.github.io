    <h1>Welcome to my introduction page</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is SeaBigsby, and I'm a cool dude. I'm a passionate learner and an adventurer who enjoys exploring new places, trying new foods, and meeting new people.</p>
    <p>I'm also a big fan of planes, and I love everything about aviation. I love learning about the history of flight, the engineering that goes into building planes, and the experience of flying through the air. It's a truly amazing experience!</p>
    <p>While I love dinosaurs, I have to admit that I might be allergic to them. Whenever I'm around fossil exhibits or dinosaur models, I sometimes start to feel itchy and my nose starts to run. It's a strange sensation, but it hasn't stopped me from learning all I can about these fascinating creatures.</p>
    <p>When it comes to coding, I have to admit that I'm la bit of a novice. But I'm eager to learn, and I'm excited about the potential for technology to make the world a better place.</p>
    <p>Outside of my interests in planes, dinosaurs, and technology, I love spending time outdoors, hiking in the mountains, swimming in the ocean, and camping under the stars. I'm also a big fan of music, and I enjoy playing guitar and writing my own songs.</p>
    <p>But enough about me. I'd love to get to know you better, too! Feel free to drop me a line and introduce yourself.</p>
